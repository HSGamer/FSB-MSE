      abstract="Online examinations gradually become popular due to Covid 19 pandemic. Environmentally friendly, saving money, and convenient,... are some of the advantages when taking exams online. Besides its major benefits, online examinations also have some serious adversities, especially integrity and cheating. There are some existing proctoring systems that support anti-cheating, but most of them have a low probability of predicting fraud based on students' gestures and posture. As a result, our article will introduce an online examination called ExamEdu that supports integrity, in which the accuracy of detecting cheating behaviors is 96.09{\%} using transfer learning and fine-tuning for ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network.",

ABSTRACT = {Because the COVID-19 epidemic has limited human activities, it has touched almost every sector. Education is one of the most affected areas. To prevent physical touch between students, schools and campuses must adapt their complete learning system to an online environment. The difficulty with this technique arises when the teachers or lecturers administer exams. It is difficult to oversee pupils one by one online. This research proposes the development of a computer program to aid in this effort. By applying deep learning models, this program can detect a person’s activities during an online exam based on a web camera. The reliability of this system is 84.52% based on the parameter F1-score. This study built an Indonesian-language web-based application. Teachers and lecturers in Indonesia can use this tool to evaluate whether students are cheating on online exams. Unquestionably, this application is a tool that may be utilized to develop distance learning educational technology in Indonesia.},

The proposed system depicts a new use of technology to identify malpractice in E-Exams which is essential due to growth of online education. The current solu-tions for such a problem either require complete manual labor or have various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an examinee. The proposed application en-compasses an end-to-end system that assists an examiner/evaluator in deciding whether a student passes an online exam without any probable attempts of mal-practice or cheating in e-exams with the help of visual aids. The system works by categorizing the student’s VFOA (visual focus of attention) data by capturing the head pose estimates and eye gaze estimates using state-of-the-art machine learn-ing techniques. The system only requires the student (test-taker) to have a func-tioning internet connection along with a webcam to transmit the feed. The exam-iner is alerted when the student wavers in his VFOA, from the screen greater than X, a predefined threshold of times. If this threshold X is crossed, the appli-cation will save the data of the person when his VFOA is off the screen and send it to the examiner to be manually checked and marked whether the action per-formed by the student was an attempt at malpractice or just momentary lapse in concentration. The system use a hybrid classifier approach where two different classifiers are used, one when gaze values are being read successfully (which may fail due to various reasons like transmission quality or glare from his specta-cles), the model falls back to the default classifier which only reads the head pose values to classify the attention metric, which is used to map the student’s VFOA to check the likelihood of malpractice. The model has achieved an accuracy of 96.04 percent in classifying the attention metric.}, number={08}, journal={International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)}, author={Indi, Chirag S and Pritham, Varun and Acharya, Vasundhara and Prakasha, Krishna}, year={2021}, month={Apr.}, pages={pp. 47–60} }
